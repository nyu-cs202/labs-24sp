WEENSYOS
========

Type `make run` to run our OS using the QEMU emulator. We expect this
to work only on Linux hosts (including Linux VMs). If you have problems, check
out Troubleshooting below.

Running the OS
--------------

There are several ways to run the OS.

*   `make run`

    Build the OS and pop up a QEMU window to run it. Close the QEMU
    window to exit the OS.

*   `make run-console`

    Build the OS and run QEMU in the current terminal window. Type
    Control-C in the terminal to exit the OS.

In all of these run modes, QEMU also creates a file named `/tmp/log.txt`.
As you debug you may find it useful to add your own calls to `log_printf`
within the kernel; output from log_printf goes to /tmp/log.txt.

Finally, run `make clean` to clean up your directory.

NOTE: when running under Docker containerization, `make run` and `make run-console` do the same thing, because Docker does not provide a graphical interface, so QEMU (running on Linux in Docker) does not offer graphics hardware to the guest OS.

Source
------

Real operating systems are big. We have tried to boil down this OS to
a minimum, comment it to help you, and separate x86 specifics from
more fundamental issues. Here is an overview of the code.

=== Important code ===

*   `kernel.c`: The kernel. Uses functions declared and described in
    `kernel.h` and `lib.h`.
*   `p-allocator.c`, `p-fork.c`, and `p-forkexit.c`: The applications.
    Uses functions declared and described in `process.h` and `lib.h`.

=== Support code ===

You may read these if you're interested but you should be able to do
the lab using only the code and descriptions in `kernel.c`, `lib.h`,
and `kernel.h`.

*   `bootstart.S`, `boot.c`: The bootloader.
*   `k-hardware.c`: Functions that set up x86 hardware state using
    programmed I/O and memory-mapped I/O instructions.
*   `k-exception.S`: Kernel assembly code for handling exceptions
    (interrupts, traps, and faults).
*   `k-loader.c`: Kernel program loader, which loads processes from
    "image files" into memory.
*   `process.c`: Support code for applications.
*   `lib.c`, `lib.h`: Support code useful in both the kernel and
    applications.
*   `x86-64.h`: x86-64 hardware definitions, including functions that
    correspond to important x86-64 instructions.
*   `elf.h`: ELF support information. (ELF is a format used for
    executables.)

Build Files
-----------

The main output of the build process is a disk image, `weensyos.img`.
QEMU "boots" off this disk image, but it could also boot on real
hardware! The build process also produces other files that you can
look at and puts them in the `obj/` directory.

*   `obj/kernel.asm`

    This file is the output of `objdump -S` on the kernel. Use it to see
    the kernel's assembly code.

*   `obj/kernel.sym`

    This smaller file just lists all the kernel's symbols (i.e.,
    variable names).

*   `obj/p-allocator.asm`, `obj/p-allocator.sym`, ...

    Similar files are generated for process code.

Troubleshooting
---------------

The OS runs using the QEMU full-system emulator. If you run on your own Linux
machine (as opposed to the class containerization environment or a virtual
cs202 devbox), you will need to install QEMU yourself. On Debian- and
Ubuntu-based hosts, run `sudo apt-get install qemu`. On Fedora-based hosts, run
`sudo yum install qemu-system-x86`.

If Control-C doesn't work on your QEMU, make sure you are using an
actual Control key. On some machines QEMU ignores key remappings (such
as swapping Control and Caps Lock).

If Control-C still doesn't work on your QEMU, forcibly close it by
running `make kill`.
