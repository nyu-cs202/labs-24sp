## Basic C Programming Lab consists of three components

1. Component-1 is under the `mini/` subdirectory. Complete the code in `part[1-3].c`. Test them 
individually (for example, test part1 by typing `build/part1`) and altogether (by typing `./grade-lab`).

2. Component-2 is under the `fromscratch/` subdirectory.  You will write two C programs from scratch. 
Each program should be in its separate directory with a Makefile: `first3/`, `countas/`.

3. Component-3 is under the `dbg` subdirectory. It is a short debugging exercise.
